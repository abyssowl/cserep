  <h1>Here are the lyrics to "Close to you" because it was what I was listening to at the time</h1>
  <p>Why do birds suddenly appear</br>Every time you are near?</br>Just like me, they long to be</br>Close to you</br></br>Why do stars fall down from the sky</br>
  Every time you walk by?</br>Just like me, they long to be</br>Close to you</br></br>On the day that you were born the angels got together</br>And decided to 
  create a dream come true</br>So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair</br>Of golden starlight in your eyes of blue</br></br>That is why all the girls in town</br>
  (Girls in town)</br>Follow you</br>(Follow you)</br>All around</br>(All around)</br>Just like me, they long to be</br>Close to you</br></br>On the day that you
  were born the angels got together</br>And decided to create a dream come true</br>So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair</br>Of golden starlight in your eyes of blue
  </br></br>That is why all the girls in town</br>(Girls in town)</br>Follow you</br>(Follow you)</br>All around</br>(All around)</br>Just like me, they long to be</br>
  Close to you</br>Just like me, they long to be</br>Close to you</br>(Why? Close to you)</br>(Why? Close to you)</br>(Haa, close to you)</br>(Why? Close to you)</p>
